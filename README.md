# Battle

This project is part of the Makers Academy weekly challenges schedule. The aim of this challenge is to develop an understanding of setting up a web project with testing frameworks such as Sinatra, Rspec and creating functional tests that simulate how users would interact with your application with capybara.

## User Stories

As two Players,
So we can play a personalised game of Battle,
We want to Start a fight by entering our Names and seeing them

As Player 1,
So I can see how close I am to winning
I want to see Player 2's Hit Points

As Player 1,
So I can win a game of Battle,
I want to attack Player 2, and I want to get a confirmation

As Player 1,
So I can start to win a game of Battle,
I want my attack to reduce Player 2's HP by 50

## Using this program
Clone this repo
Run 'rackup -p 4567' and visit 'http://localhost:4567'
Enter your name and your opponent's name and submit
'Attack' them by pressing 'attack', which will reduce their HP by 50.

## Learning Objectives
The request/response cycle.
Clients and Servers.
Using a framework (Sinatra) in your code.
Using capybara to see how users would interact with the application.
Testing apps that have user interaction and visual output.
Tracing data between the browser and server.

## Progress
Working in pairs through the week we took our time in an attempt to fully understand testing, request/response cycle, clients and servers etc. Due to a relatively slow pace of learning I was not able to make as much progress as I would have liked on this project, however I am pleased that I have developed a good understanding of the learning objectives above.
